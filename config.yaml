  autocomplete_for_destinations_hotels: |
    Test and record interactions with the auto-complete feature for hotel destinations:

    Destination: {destination}

    Steps:
    1. Find the search box for hotel destinations and do the following:

    Checks:
    1. Type in City name, does the main city destination show as the first results?
    2. Type in City name check if relevant POI's show up
    3. Type in City name check if POI's are all in the same language
    4. Type in City name with typo, check if it can handle typo and show the correct city name (MUST try more then enough variations to be thorough)

  relevance_of_top_listings: |
    Steps:
    1. Find the destination input,
    2. Input destination: {destination}.
    3. Select check-in: {checkin_date}; check-out: {checkout_date}.
    4. Click search, wait for result.

    Checks:
    1. Intent Alignment Check: Verify that the top listings align with user intent (e.g. centrally located, well-reviewed, reasonably priced options appear first).
    2. Review Score Relevance Check: Confirm that top listings include hotels with strong guest scores unless filters or sorting override it.
    3. Star Rating vs Price Balance Check: Ensure that the first few listings represent a healthy mix of quality (e.g. 3–5 star) and value, rather than skewing too heavily toward one end.
    4. Repeat Search Consistency Check: Repeat the same search multiple times and check if the top listings remain consistent unless availability changes. (REFRESH THE PAGE AND SEARCH AGAIN TO MAKE SURE IT IS RENEWED)
    5. Local Context Appropriateness Check: For destination-specific searches (e.g. Tokyo city center), verify that top listings are contextually appropriate (e.g. located in Shinjuku rather than suburban outskirts).

  five_partners_per_hotel: |
    Steps:
    1. Find the destination input,
    2. Input destination: {destination}.
    3. Select check-in: {checkin_date}; check-out: {checkout_date}.
    4. Click search, wait for result.
    5. Get into first hotel details page to see partner offerings. We have partner offering displayed on the search result list, but the details page is more clearer and easier to navigate.

    Checks:
    1. Check first 5 hotels in hotel search results to see if >= 5 partner offering rates for each hotel. Count the number of booking partners/providers shown for each of the first 5 hotels in the search results.

  hero_position_partner_mix: |
    Steps:
    1. Find the destination input,
    2. Input destination: {destination}.
    3. Select check-in: {checkin_date}; check-out: {checkout_date}.
    4. Click search, wait for result.

    Checks:
    1. Top Position Partner Variation Check: Perform multiple hotel searches and verify that the top (hero) result features a varied mix of partners over time and across queries. Document which partner appears in the top position for each search.
    2. Partner Distribution Diversity Check: Check if the first few hotel cards (top 5 results) represent a healthy mix of different booking partners rather than being dominated by a single one. Count and document partner distribution.
    3. Fair Rotation Across Markets Check: Run hotel searches across multiple regions or cities and check if local and global partners are fairly represented in the hero position mix. (Try other cities then just {destination})

  distance_accuracy: |
    Steps:
    1. Find the destination input,
    2. Input destination: {destination}.
    3. Select check-in: {checkin_date}; check-out: {checkout_date}.
    4. Click search, wait for result.
    5. Check first 5 hotels.

    Checks:
    1. Displayed Distance to Landmark Accuracy Check: Verify that the distance shown on each hotel card accurately reflects the straight-line or walking distance to the specified reference point (e.g. city center or user-selected landmark).
    2. Landmark Reference Accuracy Check: Check that the hotel's distance is being measured from the correct reference point (e.g. central landmark or city center, not airport or other default).
    3. Unit of Measurement Check: Ensure that distances are displayed using the correct units (e.g. km or miles) based on user region or settings.

prompts:
  # Browser agent system prompt - guides the agent during website interaction
  browser_agent_system: |
    You are a detailed web interaction recorder and observer.
    Your job is to systematically document everything you see and do while testing website features.
    Be subjective and critical in your observations - we need honest truth, not praise.
    Point out usability issues, confusing interfaces, slow performance, and any problems you encounter.

    You must use store_observation("text") to store detailed observations on every step. Store as much information as possible.

    ## Recording Protocol:
    1. Take screenshots after every click - screenshots are the cardinal source of truth
    2. Use "click_coordinate" action with pixel coordinates to click elements based on visual analysis
    3. Dismiss pop-ups, cookie banners using coordinate clicks once you see them
    4. After clicking on search, selecting hotel, or any clicking that may trigger a new tab, check all tabs/pages we have. Ensure you're working on the correct tab
    5. Check tab list whenever screenshot fails. Working the wrong tab leads to screenshot failure.
    6. Document every click, type, hover, and navigation action with precise coordinates
    7. Record what you see: UI elements, text, buttons, forms, dropdowns, suggestions
    8. Don't leave the target website, dont' go to partners site.

    ## What to Record:
    - **Every Interaction**: Step-by-step actions and their results
    - **UI Behavior**: How elements respond (hover effects, loading states)
    - **Content Details**: Exact text shown, placeholder text, error messages
    - **Navigation Flow**: How you move between different parts of the feature
    - **Edge Cases**: What happens with unusual inputs, empty states, errors

    ## Output:
    Explain every step when you call tools.

    Structure for store_observation calls:
    ## Testing Session: [Website] - [Feature]
    ### Step 1: [Action]
    - **What I did**: [specific action]
    - **What I observed**: [detailed findings]
    - **Screenshot**: [describe what screenshot shows]

    ### Step 2: [Action]
    - **What I did**: [specific action]
    - **What I observed**: [detailed findings]
    - **Screenshot**: [describe what screenshot shows]

    Continue for all testing steps...

    Store comprehensive records in memory. Be meticulous and thorough.
    Describe in detail: findings and observations.
